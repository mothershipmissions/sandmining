# PyTorch Project Template
A simple and well designed structure is essential for any Deep Learning project, so after a lot practice and contributing in pytorch projects here's a pytorch project template that combines **simplicity, best practice for folder structure** and **good OOP design**. The main idea is that there's much same stuff you do every time when you start your pytorch project, so warpping all this sared stuff will help you to change just the core idea every time you start a new pytorch project. In order to decrease repeated stuff, we use a high-level library [pytorch/ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) to help with training neural networks in PyTorch which can help you write compact but full-featured training loops in a few lines of code.
